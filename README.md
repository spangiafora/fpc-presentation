Functional Design Patterns
==========================
I am teaching myself functional programming, mostly in Haskell and Scala
with a little Clojure thrown in.  One of the things I have found most
confusing is a set of common *type classes.*

The related concepts are functor, applicative functor, monoid, monad.

This is a slide show I put together for review at the Amherst, MA
Functional Programming Connoisseurs meetup.  It is a work in progress.
I expect to update it a lot in the coming weeks. (It is now April 30,
2013.)
