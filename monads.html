    <h1>Types and Type Classes in Functional Programming</h1>
    <h2>(Actually, what are functors, monoids, and monads?)</h2>
    <p>
     I am teaching myself functional programming, mostly in Haskell and Scala
     with a little Clojure thrown in.  One of the things I have found most
     confusing is a set of common <span class="emphasize">type classes.</span>
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
     I've read a number of descriptions and analogies to explain what
     these things are.  I think if you get formally into type theory
     there is an exact answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have seen some attempts to compare them to interfaces in
     Java. I think they operate at a higher level of abstraction than
     Java interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think a better analogy in the software development world is to
     design patterns, in the original sense of a vocabulary for
     describing strategies - not necessarily best practices.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
     Before getting into technical details we should take a higher
     level look at a couple of the problems these type classes address.
    </p>
    <h4>Sequencing</h4>
     In the presence of lazy evaluation, expressions
     <ol>
      <li>may be evaluated out of order
      <li>may be evaluated more than once
     </ol>
    <p>
     Sequencing and pipelining of functions can be done with a number
     of these type classes.
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <h4>Function composition with strong static typing</h4>
     Given a function that returns a type that is the type of a
     parameter to another, function the two functions can be combined
     to produce a third.
     <pre>
      <code>&nbsp;user> (defn add1 [n] (+ 1 n))
       #'user/add1
       user> (defn add2 [n] (+ 2 n))
       #'user/add2
       user> (let [add3 (comp add1 add2)] (add3 4))
       7
       user></code>
     </pre>
     If you try to combine two functions and the leftmost function
     (the one calling the result of the other) doesn't accept the type
     of the rightmost function's return value as the type of its argument,
     they cannot be usefully combined.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <h4>Simplifying code</h4>
    At the first meetup of this group I asked Chas what monads were,
    and he said they were just a term for something I was already
    doing.  There's some truth to that.  But they are also a way
    of simplifying something common.  A lot of the examples show
    code getting deeply indented and then an equivalent one liner 
    using monads.  
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h3>Type Classes</h3>
    <p>
     Haskell is a simple uncluttered language to describe these things
     in.  It supports the notion of "type classes," which describe
     behavior (such as ordering or testing for equality) that is
     shared by a number of types, and "type constructors" which
     essentially define parameterized types.  So List is a type
     constructor which is an instance of a number of type classes,
     including the ones we will be discussing.  So in a sense:
     <br><br>the type [String] which signifies "list of String" in
     Haskell corresponds to the type List&lt;String&gt; in Java.<br><br> 
     (Also, for historical reasons, List is a type in its own right in
     Java. In Haskell it is not.)
    </p>
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h3>Summary</h3> 
    These type classes are each defined by a set of functions and a set of 
    rules.
    <br><br>
    Note: One of the reasons I think of these as related to design patterns 
    is that there is nothing <span class="emphasize">in the language</span> 
    that enforces these rules.

    <h3>Functor</h3>
    A class of types that support the "map" operation (called fmap in this example):
    <ol>
     <li>str2float n = read n :: Float
     <li>str2float "1" returns 1.0
     <li><span class="highlight">fmap str2float ["1", "2", "3"] returns [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]</span>
    </ol>
    This example shows List as a functor.
   </div>

   <div class="slide">
    <h3>Applicative Functor</h3>
    Given a function, foo, that converts "1" to 1, 2 to "2" and anything
    else to "bigger"<br>
    <span class="highlight">[foo] &lt;*&gt; [1, 2, 3] returns ["1","2","bigger"]</span>

     value or no value.<br><br>
     "Maybe" in Haskell, which is called "Option" in Scala, and which

     constructor whose possible values are:<br>

     </div>
     The &gt;&gt;= operation is called "bind."  It binds the value of the monad (left side)
     to the parameter of the function (right side). "return" takes a value and puts
     it into a monad.

    <h3>Monad syntactic sugar</h3>

     To make this easier to use many languages introduce syntactic sugar. In 
     Haskell this is "do" notation and in Scala it is "for" expressions.  
     <br>
     For example, the highlighted part of this code in scala:
     <pre>
      <code>
       <span class="highlight">
       def z(x: Int) : Option[Int] =
         for {
           a &lt;- f(x)
           b &lt;- g(a)
         } yield b + 1
       </span>
       def f(x: Int) : Option[Int] = if (x &lt;= 3) Some(x + 1) else None
       def g(x: Int) : Option[Int] = Some(x * 2)
       is converted by the compiler into this:<br>
       <span class="highlight">
       def z(x: Int): Option[Int] = f(x).flatMap(((a) =&gt; g(a).map(((b) =&gt; b.$plus(1)))));</span>

     Monads have other useful attributes that I won't go into in depth here.

    <h3>Things to discuss?</h3>
    <div class="inner">
     <p>
      In poking around the web I have found a lot of tutorials on
      monads, and a lot of advice to the effect that monads are not
      fundamental to Haskell and are not the place to start.  That's
      true.  However, scratch the surface of any Haskell program and
      you are likely to find at least functors if not some of the more
      advanced type classes.  
     </p>
     <p>
      I am curious where these concepts fit in to functional
      programming. Certain concepts are central to functional
      programming in any language, from Lisp, to ML, to Scala, to
      Haskell, and even in the more functional aspects of Ruby and
      Python.  Key among these are map, filter, reduce, lambda and
      their friends.

    <h3>Things to discuss? (continued)</h3>

     <p>
      The things described in this presentation seem less ubiquitous.
      My impression, at least is that the following are true:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       When you start learning Haskell you encounter these concepts
       pretty directly.
      </li>
      <li>
       ML books generally talk about functors, although with a
       slightly different meaning.  They don't tend to mention monads
       (but then, the ML books I own are showing their age in other
       ways, so who knows...)
      </li>
      <li>
       As far as I remember, Odersky didn't mention any of these terms
       in his "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" Coursera
       offering.  However, several of the lessons focused specifically 
       on the underlying principles while avoiding the vocabulary.
      </li>
      <li>
       I don't think I have seen any of these terms used in any Lisp books.
       My gut feeling is that while they are applicable to just about any
       programming environment, their value really comes into play in 
       strongly statically typed languages.
