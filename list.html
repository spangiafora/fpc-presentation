   <li>
    How familiar are you guys with this stuff?<br><br>It looks like
    writing a blog on monads is a rite of passage.  I don't want to
    bore people by making them sit through yet another one.  On the
    other hand, I did not have the *aha* moment that so many people
    describe.  The definitions of these things is pretty
    straightforward.  On the other hand I think to be able to know
    when they are appropriate in a solution is an art that takes time
    to pick up.
   </li>
   <li>
     Bear with me.  I am new to this stuff.  I now understand the
     basics of monads but:
     <ul>
      <li>I am still not clear on the theoretical underpinnings
      <li>I know places where they can be used, but I am not sure where
          they are most appropriate.
      <li>They are more algebraic than most things you encounter in java
      <li>I am hoping this will be more of a discussion than a lecture.
     </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
     One of the confusing things in reading about this stuff is that
     if you are not familiar with math (and the last time I encountered
     math in a school situation was before many of you were born) 
     you don't necessarily realize that sometimes greek letters are
     just variables and sometimes they have a particular meaning.  In 
     addition, a lot of type explanations put things in terms of Haskell's 
     type syntax, which I am sure is based on category theory, 
     without explaining the notation or telling you where you can 
     look it up.
   </li>
   <li>
     Monad was added to Haskell as a type class before Functor, so some
     of the classes don't have the relationship you might reasonably expect.
   </li>
   <li>
     map existed before fmap.  If you apply fmap improperly to a list,
     the first structure beginners typically deal with, you get a
     confusing diagnostic message.
   </li>
   <li>
     Type constructor and data constructor.  List (really []) is a
     difficult one to describe because it is overloaded.
   </li>
   <li>
     Function composition:  Explain Just/Maybe/Nothing.
   </li>
   <li>
     Explain bind, >>=.  Binds the value of the monad to the 
     parameter of the function.
   </li>
   <li>
    Monad syntactic sugar. - The important thing here is that it is still
    just function combination and application. 
   </li>
   <li>
    Scala and Haskell differ in their view of types.  In Haskell you
    map a function over a container you expect to get the same
    container back.  In Scala you may or may not.  Scala is more permissive.
    Clojure is probably similar.
   </li>
  </ul> 
 <ul>
   <li>
    Reasons for confusion:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Last week I was an expert.  This week I don't know a thing.  So this
      will be more a discussion than a presentation.
     </li>
     <li>
      People understand things by example and analogy, so they try
      to translate the concepts to familiar terms such as javascript.
     </li>
     <li>
      Javascript is weakly typed and strict.  The use of monads in programming
      was introduced initially in Haskell, which is very strongly typed and lazy.
      Some of the reasons for using monads are not compelling in Javascript, and
      not even needed in a strict functional language such as Erlang.
     </li>
     <li>
      Once people understand the concepts in the familiar environment they can 
      see uses for them.  However, they may still be unfamiliar with the reasons
      they were devised to begin with.  (I am thinking of Crockford, here.)
     </li>
     <li>
      The concepts don't directly correspond simply to language
      features.  They are more like an algebra or a design pattern.
      Wadler refers to them as a "strategy." Monads are not so much a
      thing as formal characteristics of a number of things.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Make sure that early on in the slides there is a definition of monad as:
    <ul>
     <li>unit
     <li>bind
     <li>type constructor
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Differentiate between type constructors and data constructors.
   </li>
   <li>
    Give an example of writing a function that naturally takes an int argument
    and naturally returns a Maybe Int.  Then show another, and demonstrate
    how it is desirable to be able to compose them.  
   </li>
   <li>
    modularity / flexibility / isolation - see All About Monads
   </li>
   <li>
    Read LYAH before reading Wadler or any articles that use Haskell's type notation.
   </li>
   <li>
    List comprehension is a monadic operation, except that it is specifically 
    associated with lists.  Explain why map and fmap exist in Haskell.
   </li>
   <li>
    Membership in Monad type class in Haskell makes a type usable in
    "do" notation.  Implementation of flatMap, map and filter makes a
    type usable in "for: notation in Scala.  Tie this to expansion of for loop 
    by the compiler.
   </li>
  </ul>
