  <h1>Some titles for possible review</h1>
  <p>
   I don't intend this to be exhaustive and I certainly don't expect
   us to cover more than a fraction of what is listed here.  These
   are just books that might lead to worthwhile discussions.  Most of 
   them are fairly recent.  Others have been around for decades and
   are probably familiar titles to people in this group.  Others have
   not yet been published.
