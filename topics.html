     <span class="title">Various Resources</span><br>
     What web sites and other (non-book) resources are worth discussing?
     Parenthetically Speaking (although it is showing its age), 
     <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/">A neighborhood of infinity</a>, 
     and Lambda The Ultimate come to mind. Others?
     <br>
     If nothing else, would it be worth developing a wiki of links to
     things like this? Would constructing a wiki as a group be a way
     of keeping the group going?  Chas apologized (unnecessarily) for
     starting off the group with a discussion of the value of
     immutability.  He felt he had underestimated the maturity of the
     group with respect to Functional programming.  However, we never really
     did find out what level most of the group is at or what things 
     they'd like to know more about or share more about.  I asked about monads
     at the first meeting most of the useful responses came <i>after</i> the
     meetup.
     <br>
     I am also somewhat curious how people came to functional programming
     and what languages they have worked in and why.

     <span class="title">Rosetta Code part 2</span>
     <br>
     Similar to first talk, but stressing things that cannot be done in 
     other languages.  The only thing that immediately comes to mind
     is Macros in the various Lisps and Reader Macros in Common Lisp,
     but I am sure there are others.

     <span class="title">Memoization</span> as solution, for example,
     to complexity of pegpuzzle problem.  How far does it get you?  We
     talked about using a mutable hashmap behind the scenes while
     maintaining referential transparency externally.
     Is there a purely functional alternative that is not too clumsy?

     I also think it would be interesting to discuss the characteristics of Imperative,
     Object Oriented, and Functional languages.  For one thing, I think the terms Object Oriented
     and Functional are orthoganol.  For another, I believe many things are erroneously 
     claimed as characteristics of one group or another. <br>See:

     <span class="title">Frameworks</span>
     The Java world has exploded into a collection of frameworks.  Most serious
     organizations make use of something like Spring or Guice.  Many use 
     maven.  To what extent are these good practices and to what extent
     are they not necessary in the functional world?

     <span class="title">Design Patterns.</span> Norvig and Graham
     have written that they consider them a bad sign.  A lot of OO
     programmers have misunderstood them and turned them from a
     language into a list of "best practices," if not an out and out
     religion.  Interestingly, many of the people who came up with
     them (e.g. Richard Gabriel) are situated pretty firmly in the
     Lisp community.  To what extent are these patterns appropriate to
     functional design? To what extend does functional programming
     define its own patterns?  (I would argue that monad and company
     are a good example of functional design patterns.)

     Do trends like AOP have a place in the functional world?  (Again,

     of the Parc guys driving it.)

     The yet-again delayed project Lambda.  How does it work? When

     about Guy Steel's statement, "We were not out to win over the
     Lisp programmers; we were after the C++ programmers. We managed
     to drag a lot of them about halfway to Lisp. Aren't you happy?"
